Where's My Bike is a mobile web app for iOS devices that helps Amsterdam bicyclists retrieve their bike if (when!) it goes missing.

Made for the 2011 [Apps for Amsterdam](http://www.appsforamsterdam.nl/) competition. A live version of Where's My Bike can be found at http://labs.bubblefoundry.com/wheresmybike/. It won a prize!
